                    A Full-Round Action consumes all of your effort during a given round,
                    effectively replacing all other Actions on your turn.
                    A Full-Round Action can't span multiple Rounds;
                    for example, you cannot perform a Full-Round Action that replaces your Move Action,
                    and Swift Action in the first Round and your Standard Action in the following Round.

                    As a Full-Round Action, you can make more than one attack.
                    To gain extra attacks, you must be wielding two weapons, wielding a double weapon,
                    or using a special ability that grants extra attacks. When making multiple attacks,
                    you may resolve your attacks in any order desired,
                    declaring the target of each attack immediately before making the attack roll.
                    Extra attacks granted from different sources are cumulative.
                    Any penalties associated with gaining an extra attack apply to all
                    attacks that the character makes until the start of their next turn.

                    A Standard Action is usually the most important Action
                    you'll take in a round, and it often consists of some sort of
                    attack- swinging a Lightsaber, firing a blaster, throwing a punch,
                    hurling a Grenade, and so on. You can perform one Standard Action on
                    your turn.

                    A Move Action represents physical movement.
                    The most common Move Action is moving up to your speed score.
                    You can perform one Move Action on your turn,
                    or two if you give up your Standard Action.
                    With the exception of specific movement related Skills,
                    most Move Actions don't require Skill Checks.
                    In some cases (Such as shouldering a stuck door),
                    Ability Checks might be required.

                    Things that require very little time or effort can be accomplished
                    with a Swift Action. Some Actions, Feats, and Talents require one
                    or more Swift Actions to perform. You normally get one Swift Action
                    per Round, but you can take a second Swift Action instead of a
                    Standard Action or Move Action, and you can take three Swift
                    Actions in a Round if you give up both your Standard Action
                    and Move Action. Multiple Swift Actions usually have to occur
                    on the same Round, or consecutive Rounds, and some Actions require
                    that the multiple Swift Actions be consecutive (That is, no other
                    Action interrupts them). This is noted in the Action's description.
